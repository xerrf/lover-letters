            <h2>Dear Bash</h2>
            <p><span>Oh, Bash</span>,  you sly devil. In the end, I wish I could forget you, and I assume you wish the same about me though I know that you have a great memory of what I have said to you.</p>
            <p>In the beginning, I was staring out of my <span>windows</spa> and saw you walking by. Right then I knew I had to have you but you were gone in an instant. I searched the internet trying to find you, perhaps that makes me a stalker. It was a bit of a pain to find you, but a friend names <span>Ubuntu</span> lead me to you.</p>
            <p><span>Bourne-Again Shell</span>, you said, <span>Bash</span> for short. I was smitten by your simplicity and organization. Always knowing where I stood was only a <span>pwd</span> a way. Not to mention how you <span>ls</span> and even <span>ls -la</span>everything for me. I knew you were a <span>man</span>, but I never thought you were a <span>man</span>&apos;s <span>man</span>. You were so open to me about everything you could do and had been through. You <span>touch</span>ed me in ways <span>mkdir</span> couldn&apos;t and were good at keeping my secrets with your <span>ssh</span> and <span>scp</span>.</p>
            <p>Soon though, you became too attached and things became so routine. The passion was gone. You even started <span>echo</span>ing what I said back to me. We went down different <span>branches</span> that <span>forked</span> in opposite directions. You started to try to impress me with your <span>sudo apt-get install cowsay.</span> You would imitate a cow and speak to me. It was creepy. </p>
            <p>Anyway, it&apos;s over.</p>
