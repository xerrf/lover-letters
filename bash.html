                <p id="2"><span class="green">~beve3854:</span>$ <span class="text">In the beginning, I was staring out of my <span class="h">windows</span> and saw you walking by. Right then I knew I had to have you but you were gone in an instant. I searched the internet trying to find you, perhaps that makes me a stalker. It was a bit of a pain to find you, but a friend names <span class="h">Ubuntu</span> lead me to you.</span></p>
                <p id="3"><span class="green">~beve3854:</span>$ <span class="text"><span class="h">Bourne-Again Shell</span>, you said, <span class="h">Bash</span> for short. I was smitten by your simplicity and organization. Always knowing where I stood was only a <span class="h">pwd</span> a way. Not to mention how you <span class="h">ls</span> and even <span class="h">ls -la</span> everything for me. I knew you were a <span class="h">man</span>, but I never thought you were a <span class="h">man</span>&apos;s <span class="h">man</span>. You were so open to me about everything you could do and had been through. You <span class="h">touch</span>ed me in ways <span class="h">mkdir</span> couldn&apos;t and were good at keeping my secrets with your <span class="h">ssh</span> and <span class="h">scp</span>.</span></p>
                <p id="4"><span class="green">~beve3854:</span>$ <span class="text">Soon though, you became too attached and things became so routine. The passion was gone. You even started <span class="h">echo</span>ing what I said back to me. We went down different <span class="h">branches</span> that <span class="h">forked</span> in opposite directions. You started to try to impress me with your <span class="h">sudo apt-get install cowsay.</span> You would imitate a cow and speak to me. It was creepy.</span></p>
                <p id="5"><span class="green">~beve3854:</span>$ <span class="text">Anyway, it&apos;s over.</span></p>
