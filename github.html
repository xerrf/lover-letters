            <p>Like father like son, isn&apos;t that right <span>Github</span>? I should have known that his relationship wasn&apos;t going to work. You make everything so <span>public</span> for the whole world to see. I&apos;ve got a <span>repository</span> of memories of you and none of them are good. Just like your son, you could never <span>commit</span> to me. I tried so hard to <span>push</span> you in the right direction and when I threatened to leave you acted as you changed. But I won't be fooled anymore, every time you <span>pull</span> me back I realize that nothing I did mattered, like the changes I <span>pushed</span> for had been <span>overwritten</span>.</p>
            <p>Late at night, I would see my phone light up with the message, <span>&ldquo;README&rdquo;</span> and I would fall for it, but never again, I&apos;m not interested in a relationship of <span>collaboration</span> between more than two people.</p>
            <p>You look like a stalker when you use your <span>social feature</span>, watching their <span>repos</span> grow into big projects. I guess that&apos;s how you found me so I shouldn&apos;t be surprised that you are still lurking about.</p>
            <p>Well, it&apos;s done. I am done with your family forever!</p>
