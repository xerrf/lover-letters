# lover-letters
Creative SOPs for Bash, Git, and Github

## About
This is a project to get familiar with using bash, git, and github. We are supposed to write a mash of up SOP and lover-letters to each of these tools. Though I am supposed to be inlove with them, I chose to write breakup letters to each of them because it was more fun. I do think they are valuable.
