            <p>There is no silence with you, its always &ldquo;<span>git</span> that&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span>git</span> this&rdquo;, &ldquo;<span>git git git git git</span>&rdquo; everything. So repetitive; how can anyone stand you?</p>
            <p>When we first met, I thought we were gonna <span>init</span> a relationship, but you just <span>add</span>ed me to your list of lovers.</p>
            <p>How many <span>versions</span> of you are out there?</p>
            <p>After a while, I caught on and asked about your <span>status</span> and you said, &ldquo;honeybuns, you know I could never <span>commit</span> to one person.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>You have all these <span>aliases</span> and different personalities. It's like you are saying words that you have defined yourself and no one knows what you're talking about.</p>
            <p>Such an ego!</p>
            <p>Well &ldquo;<span>git</span>&rdquo; this bitch</p>
